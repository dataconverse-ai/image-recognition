# Image Recognition and De-Identification Service

This project provides a FastAPI-based service for image recognition and de-identification, specifically tailored for handling animal images as outlined in the project requirements. It leverages Python libraries such as OpenCV for image processing.

## Setup

### Installing Dependencies

Ensure you have Poetry installed on your system. You can install Poetry through the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```
To install the project dependencies, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
poetry install
```

This command will set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies defined in pyproject.toml.

## Running the Application
To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
poetry run uvicorn src.image_recognition.main:app --reload
```

This will start the FastAPI server on localhost at port 8000. The --reload flag enables hot reloading during development.

## API Endpoints
The service includes the following endpoints:

`POST /api/v1/images/upload-image/`: Upload an image for processing and de-identification. The endpoint expects a file upload in the form of an image.
`GET /api/v1/images/test/`: A test endpoint to check if the API is functioning properly.
## Testing
To run tests, ensure you are in the project root directory and execute:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```


This command runs the test suite, checking the functionality and response of the API endpoints.

## Documentation
The API documentation is available at http://localhost:8000/docs after you start the server. This documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI and provides an interactive Swagger UI to explore the API.
